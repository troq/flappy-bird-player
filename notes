right at the beginning, if the top pipe is larger than the bottom pipe and they're only partly showing
and the area of the part of the top pipe is above the threshold while the area of the part of the bottom
pipe is below the threshold then the top pipe will be detected as the significant pipe. I can either remove the
threshold (I don't think it's actually needed, further testing will tell) or just ignore the top pipe when it's
detected (by checking if the y val of the top right corner is below 20)
    AFTER TESTING: will need to ignore when top pipe found bc removing the threshold does not work
i think the flappy bird problem is episodic
max x_disp : 21     min x_disp  : -119
max y_disp : ?      min y_disp  : ?
